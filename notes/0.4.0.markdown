For better modularity and convenience of use, separated project into several parts:

* Library:
    + Added autogenerated links definition list ([#7](https://github.com/laughedelic/literator/pull/7))
    + Changed index building and moved index to the bottom of the document
    + Solved problem of nested comments ([#4](https://github.com/laughedelic/literator/pull/4))
    + Abstracted parsing over particular language ([#1](https://github.com/laughedelic/literator/pull/1)); Added the most useful languages
    + Made everything more `File`-centric (instead of just `String`s); 
    + Merged `literateFile/Dir` into one `File.literate()` method; 
* Sbt plugin:
    + Has `docsMap` key, for multiple mapping between srcs -> doc dirs
    + Has `docsOutputDirs` for adding them to `cleanFiles`
* Command line application:
    + So far very primitive application; planning to add some nice options and conscript cover.
